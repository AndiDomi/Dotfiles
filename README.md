## Key Neovim Features

#### Open files quick!! FZF and Ripgrep - Easy Window Splitting. All a couple of keystrokes away. Who needs file explorers.

#### Excellent and fast LSP with COC.nvim. Java support is fantastic, despite often being a struggle without a heavy IDE

#### Plus gnarly Git integrations, start screen, minimal UX and soft UI and more!
